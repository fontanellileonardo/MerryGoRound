# MerryGoRound Project
This repository contains the files and the documentation for the didactical project for the Performance Evaluation course.

## Assignment
A merry-go-round (MGR) has N seats, and children occupying a seat pay one coin for a ride. A ride takes T units of time, during which the MGR does not take anyone else on board. Children arrive and queue up at the MGR with some interarrival times (see later), and the owner may decide to run a ride even when the MGR is not full. Children may drop out of a queue with an increasing probability after a threshold time Q.
Evaluate at least the earnings per unit of time of the MGR owner depending on the threshold he/she chooses to start a ride on the MGR and the threshold Q.

More in detail, at least the following scenarios must be evaluated:
* Exponential distribution of the interarrival times.
* Burst arrivals: interarrival times are still exponential, but the number of children in one arrival is geometrically distributed.

In all cases, it is up to the team to calibrate the scenarios so that meaningful results are obtained.
